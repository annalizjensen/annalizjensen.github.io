intro: |
  Hi there! Iâ€™m a skilled software developer in the Bay Area interested in crafting delightful user experiences, building efficient and scalable software, and leading technical teams to success. I currently work at Flipboard, where I'm an engineering manager on our Core Applications team. I have primarily worked in the JVM (Java, Scala, very minor Clojure and Kotlin experience) within a microservices architecture, but I have worked across codebases throughout my career and have learned to pick the right tool for the job.
